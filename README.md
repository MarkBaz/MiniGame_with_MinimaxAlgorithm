Game Rules:
  1. Each player decides their starting position on the board.
  2. The player can make moves just like a queen in chess, horizontaly, vertically and diagonally.
  3. When a move is made, the tiles between the player's position and the tile chosen are colored black.
  4. The player can only move on white tiles.
  5. The player cannot choose to move or cross a black tile.
  6. The player with no available moves loses.

When the game starts, the size of the board must be defined and any tiles on the board can be colored black so they turn unavailable from the start.

Enjoy!
